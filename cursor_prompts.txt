using python read in the csv in dowloads called CANDIDATE_DATASET 

using python create a pandas data frame that reads from the csv in the downloads folder called CANDIDATE_DATASET

filter the dataframe to row 7

remove displaying the basic information about the dataframe

use the csv called candidate_dataset(1) on the desktop instead

split the values within the filtered dataframe, each value is delmited by ;

create a new dataframe with the split values instead of printing them

for each split add as a new row

generate a new row that is the first row multiplied by 4

convert the first row to an integer before the multiplication

transpose the dataframe. Rename the first, eight, and last columns to Quarterly Revenue, Quarter and Implied ARR

when converting the first row to integer, add error handling to coalesce to 0

filter the data frame where implied ARR is greater than 0 and drop the columns that aren't quarterly revenue, quarter, or implied arr

rename the dataframes to clarify during each step of the process

add a space in quarter between year and Q

resst the index

simplify the code where possible 

create a line plot of the data with implied ARR as the y axis as a currency and quarter as the x axis. the y axis starts at 0 

remove the vertical lines in the chart

update the y axis to be in thousands
